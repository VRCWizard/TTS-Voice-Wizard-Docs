# Media Tutorial Video

:::note
This feature does not allow you to show your **local time, GPU, CPU, RAM or... local temp**. Reason being that I believe these outputs have no inherent value to would be onlookers examining your chatbot. However it does allow you to show interactive outputs like current song info, heartrate data, and contact receiver counters.

:::

:::note
The ability to show current **time** has been added as a button, although it is only available for continuous output via KAT.

:::caution warning

Does this let you play music through your microphone? No. Just google "How to play music through your microphone" there are tons of videos on it. It just requires a virtual cable. You can use the media integration in conjunction with outputting music though your microphone so listeners know what you're playing :)

Use Media Integration to display your 'Now Playing Song' in VRChat.
