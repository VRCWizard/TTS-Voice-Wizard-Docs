## Other Settings
- You can change the update interval to change how quickly heartrate is refreshed for TTS Voice Wizard (Not how often it receives data from Pulsoid, that is dependent on how often your HR Device updates)

- Output Heartrate Directly sends your messages directly to the VRChat chatbox in a default message as long as the update interval is  greater than or equal to 1500 milliseconds.

- You can customize the message that the heartrate data is sent to the chatbox in by using the media Integration tab after connecting  your device. You would disable **Output Heartrate Directly** for this method.
