# What does DeepL do in TTS Voice Wizard?
DeepL Translation API is a method to translate text in TTS Voice Wizard. Azure Text to Text translation pricing is not the best that's why TTS Voice Wizard only uses Azure's Speech to Text translations (which have better pricing for some reason). So DeepL is an option to translate any text other than when using Azure Speech to Text for Translating. For example, when you press the "TTS" button or when using another method for speech recognition such as Vosk, System Speech or Web Captioner.
