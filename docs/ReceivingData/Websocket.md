# Websocket to TTS

- Have a program connect and send strings to ```ws://{IPAddress}:{Port}``` where {IPAddress} will me that of the machine running TTS Voice Wizard (if it is the same machine it would be "localhost"). And the specified {Port} (9008 by default)
    - Check out the [Web App (Beta)](https://ttsvoicewizard.com/WebApp) for and example of an app capable of sending data to the web socket server.
