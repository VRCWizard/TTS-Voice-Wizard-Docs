# Websocket to TTS

- Have a program connect and send strings to ```ws://{IPAddress}:{Port}``` where {IPAddress} will me that of the machine running TTS Voice Wizard (if it is the same machine it would be "localhost"). And the specified {Port} (9008 by default)
    - https://vrcwizard.github.io/TTS-Voice-Wizard-React/ is example of a web app capable of sending data to the web socket server
