:::

1. Become a member on [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/ttsvoicewizard/tiers) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ttsvoicewizard)

2. [Link your Discord account to Kofi](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8664701197073-How-do-I-join-a-Creator-s-Discord-) or [link your Discord account to Patreon](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access) and join the Discord Server


3. Navigate to the ```#get-api-key-beta``` channel in Discord
   - To get a key for the first time type: ```/create-key```
   - To refresh your key type: ```/refresh-key```
4. Your key will be DM'ed to you by the Official TTS Voice Wizard Bot in Discord

## Where do I put the API Key?
1. In TTS Voice Wizard navigate to Speech Provider > VoiceWizard Pro

2. Make sure "Use Voice Wizard Pro Key" is enabled and copy and paste your key from the discord DM to the "Voice Wizard Pro Key" text field

3. You can now choose whether to use the Pro Key for Azure, Amazon Polly and Translations. (It will automatically be used for Google Cloud voices since those are VoiceWizardPro Only)
