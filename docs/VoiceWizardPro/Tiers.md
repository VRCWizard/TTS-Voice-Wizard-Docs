## Tiers

#### Here is the break down of the tiers available via [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/ttsvoicewizard/tiers) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ttsvoicewizard)



:::info

- Speech Recognition Hours only account for using DeepGram for Speech Recognition. You could use any other recognition such as Whisper with no limit.
- The "Enchanter" tier does not give TTS characters via the Voice Wizard Pro API (only Translation characters).
- Selecting a higher tier/ upgrading will automatically reset your usage. If you downgrade or select a lower tier(before the end of your month) you will need to make a help request in discord to have your usage reset manually.
