# Setting Hotkeys
This feature is not available as apart of this ATM but you can use other handy programs for that effect <br />

## Set Hotkey On A VR Controller
- [App to bind key combinations to your VR controller](https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVR2Key) <br />
- Make sure TTSVoiceWizard is not running then set a button to "ctrl + g" (the default key bind) 
    - Close TTS Voice Wizard before doing this, if it is running it will steal the input
- Additionally, you can add a bool for ```/avatar/parameters/DoSpeechToText``` to your avatar to toggle speech-to-text

## Set Hotkey On A Mouse
