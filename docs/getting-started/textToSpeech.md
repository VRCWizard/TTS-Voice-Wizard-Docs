## ðŸ”Œ Playing Audio Through Your Microphone
1. First, you will need to [download and set up a virtual cable](/docs/getting-started/VirtualCable)
2. You will then need to change TTS Voice Wizard's **output device**  to the **virtual cable** allowing you to play the System Speech TTS through your microphone.
3. Consequently your microphone in other application like VRChat, Discord, Overwatch etc. would be the Virtual Cable.
