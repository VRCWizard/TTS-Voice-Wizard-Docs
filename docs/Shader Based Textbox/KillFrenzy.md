    - Make sure to turn on "Send Text to VRChat with KAT" in TTSVoiceWizard Settings > Text Output 
    - If it isn't working after uploading your avatar, you may have to delete your %appdata%..\LocalLow\VRChat\OSC files when re-uploading an avatar with new parameters
    - If you would like to add more functionality to Killfrenzy Avatar Text. [Frosty's Billboard](https://github.com/Frosty704/Billboard) is a KillFrenzy Avatar Text addon, it adds more functionality to the KAT such as making KAT grabbable and poseable.
