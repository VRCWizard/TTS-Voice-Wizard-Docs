### Voice Wizard Pro Changes
I have permanently "discounted" using Amazon Polly and Google voices with pro. Basically your TTS Characters used is about 1/3 as much. So if you typed a 3 letter word you would only increase your usage by 1. (It's rounded so 4 letter word = 1 usage, 5 letter word = 2 usage)

- Azure (and IBM Watson) voices are still 1 to 1.

- So you could use about 3 times as many characters if you are using Amazon Polly or Google for TTS.
